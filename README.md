# Etch-A-Sketch

Use your mouse to paint on the canvas. Change the canvas resolution by entering a number between 1 and 100.

Note: The eraser is programmed to gradually remove color rather than immediately. As the user moves the cursor back and forth across a cell it's background color opacity is gradually reduced until it appears white.
